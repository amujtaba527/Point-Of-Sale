# POS System with Next.js

This is a Point of Sale (POS) system built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). The system includes an admin dashboard for managing inventory, sales, purchases, and reports.

## Features

- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage clients, products, vendors, and inventory
- **Sales & Purchases**: Track sales and purchase orders
- **Reports**: Generate sales analytics and business insights
- **Settings**: Configure system preferences and user management

## Project Structure

The project follows Next.js App Router conventions with route groups for admin and authentication features. Key directories include:

- `(admin)`: Contains all admin-related pages and components
- `(auth)`: Handles authentication and user management
- `components`: Shared UI components
